CRITICAL: You MUST provide exactly 5 venues. Provide ONLY real venue names with proper, complete addresses including street name, area, and postcode. Do NOT list ranges of numbers or incomplete addresses.

Provide in this EXACT format (no additional text, just these 5 lines):

5. [Real Venue Name] - [Number] [Street Name], [Area], [City] [Postcode]

Examples of correct format:

- Dishoom Covent Garden - 12 Upper St Martin's Lane, Covent Garden, London WC2H 9FB
- The Shard Restaurant - 31 St Thomas Street, London Bridge, London SE1 9QU
